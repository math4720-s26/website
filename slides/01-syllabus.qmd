- Submit your work: **Assessments > Dropbox**

- Check your grade: **Assessments > Grades**

- New announcement: **News**


## Grading Policy &#x2728;

- Your final grade is earned out of **[1000]{.red} total points** distributed as follows:
  - **Homework 1 to 8: [175]{.red} pts (25 pts each)**
  - **Quiz 1 to 4: [200]{.red} pts (50 pts each)**
  - **Exam 1 and 2: [300]{.red} pts (150 pts each)**
  - **Final exam: [150]{.red} pts**
  - **AI Project: [150]{.red} pts** 
  - **Class participation: [25]{.red} pts**

- `r emo::ji("x")` No extra credit projects/homework/exam to compensate for a poor grade.

- Individual grade will **NOT** be curved.

<!-- - This is not a course that gives most of students grade A. Wanna get a good grade? Study hard. No pain, no gain! &#x270D; &#x270D; -->


## Grade-Percentage Conversion &#x2728;

- Your final grade is based on your percentage of points earned out of 1000 points.
- $[x, y)$ means greater than or equal to $x$ and less than $y$.

```{r}
#| echo: false
letter <- c("A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-",
                       "D+", "D", "F")
percentage <- c("[94, 100]", "[90, 94)", "[87, 90)", "[83, 87)", "[80, 83)",
                "[77, 80)", "[73, 77)", "[70, 73)",
                "[65, 70)", "[60, 65)", "[0, 60)")
grade_dist <- data.frame(Grade = letter, Percentage = percentage)
library(kableExtra)
knitr::kable(grade_dist, longtable = TRUE, format = "html", align = 'l') %>% kable_styling(position = "center", font_size = 35)
```




## Homework (175 pts)

- **Assessments > Dropbox** and upload your homework in **PDF** format.

- There are 8 homework sets.

- MSSC 5720 students may have more or different homework questions.

- `r emo::ji("x")` **No make-up homework**.

- The lowest score will not be in your final grade calculation.

- Using generative AI (GenAI) tools is allowed, but you **must carefully cite it or reveal your use of AI.**





## Quizzes (200 pts)

- `r emo::ji("x")` No cheat sheet or GenAI is allowed.

- `r emo::ji("x")` **No make-up quizzes** for any reason unless you got an [excused absence](https://bulletin.marquette.edu/policies/attendance/undergraduate/). Check the [syllabus](https://math4720-f25.github.io/website/course-syllabus.html#quizzes) for more details.


## Exams (450 pts)

- There are **two** midterm exams and **one** final exam.

- The midterms have *in-class* and *take-home* parts, and the final is a in-class written exam.

. . .

- **Assessments > Dropbox** to submit your take-home exams in **PDF** format.
<!-- - `r emo::ji("x")` **Handwriting is NOT allowed**. -->

- Exam 2 covers Week **7 to 11**.

- Final exam is comprehensive and covers the **all course materials**.  `r emo::ji("sunglasses")`

- `r emo::ji("x")` **No make-up exams** for any reason unless you got an [excused absence](https://bulletin.marquette.edu/policies/attendance/undergraduate/).



## AI Project (150 pts)

- There will be one AI project released around Week 13.

- You have to use GenAI to self learn a topic that is not covered in my lectures, and generate a data analysis report.

- The project topic will also be tested in the final exam.

- You **must carefully cite your GenAI tool or reveal your use of AI.**


##  What Computing Language We Use (I Teach)?

::::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- `r emo::ji("chart_with_upwards_trend") ` The best language for statistical computing!
<!-- - `r emo::ji("x") ` If you do **NOT** want to learn R, choose another section!  -->
- `r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` You may use other tools or software such as Excel, Python, Minitab, etc to do your work, but I will **NOT** teach any of them.
- `r emo::ji("x")` Drop/Swap deadline: **09/02/2025**. Don't miss it!

## Document Generative AI Use


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="80%"}

<!-- ### Generative AI -->

- You may use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Gemini to generate a first draft of text for your work, provided that this use is **documented and cited**.

<!-- [Example] Data science is an interdisciplinary field that ... [^1] -->

<!-- [^1]: ChatGPT, response to *“Tell me what data science is,”* Jan 14, 2025, https://chat.openai.com. -->

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of any online resources, but you must **explicitly cite/document** where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solutions.

<!-- ## Sharing/Reusing Code -->

<!-- - Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of any online resources, but you must **explicitly cite** where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solutions. -->

<!-- ::: notes -->
<!-- - You are responsible for the content of all work submitted for this course. -->
<!-- - You can use any code shared online or in books. But please give the authors full credits. Cite their work and let me know whose code you are using to do your homework and project. -->
<!-- - I encourage you to write your own code. This way you learn the most. -->
<!-- - `r emo::ji("x")`  Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source. `r emo::ji("scream")` -->

<!-- How I used AI: -->
<!--  I asked ChatGPT to suggest different ways to start my personal statement. -->
<!-- Generated Output (excerpt): -->
<!--  (screenshot or copy-paste excerpt) -->
<!-- “One way to begin your personal statement could be with a defining moment: ‘The first time I stood in front of a classroom, I realized that teaching was not just a profession—it was my calling.’ Another option is to highlight your motivation with a story of overcoming a challenge…” -->
<!-- How I used it: -->
<!--  I reviewed the suggestions, but I did not use the exact wording. Instead, I used the idea of starting with a defining moment and wrote my own opening sentence. -->


 
## Academic Integrity

This course expects all students to follow University and College statements on [academic integrity](https://bulletin.marquette.edu/undergrad/academicregulations/).

- **Honor Pledge and Honor Code**: *I recognize the importance of personal integrity in all aspects of life and work. I commit myself to truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, by which I earn the respect of others. I support the development of good character, and commit myself to uphold the highest standards of academic integrity as an important aspect of personal integrity. My commitment obliges me to conduct myself according to the Marquette University Honor Code*.
<!-- - `r emo::ji("x")` You know what I am talking about. Yes, **DO NOT CHEAT**.  -->
