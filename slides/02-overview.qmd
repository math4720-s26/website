::: notes

- Let's take a short break, and we can start talking about statistics.
- The first and big question we usually ask is What is statistics.

:::

## Statistics as Numeric Records

- In ordinary conversations, the word **statistics** is used as a term to indicate a set or collection of **numeric records**.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/02-overview/mj_stats.png")
```

::: notes

- For example, some NBA star's career statistics are right here.
- Anyone know who he is? Wanna guess?

- Yes, Michael Jordan! My favorite NBA player. 
- You know I was born in 80's.
- You guys didn't watch MJ playing, but I did. in TV. OK.
- Your idol may be Kobe, or LBJ or Stephen Curry, but for people born in 80's, or your parents, most of them would agree MJ is the greatest of all time.
- OK I am gone too far.
- Again, in ordinary conversations, the word **statistics** represents **numeric records**.

::: notes

- And somebody defines statistics as the only field where two experts, using identical data, may come to completely opposite conclusions, which is true in some sense.
- And well see why later in this course.
- With the same data, different statistical methods may produce different results and lead to difference conclusions.

::: notes

- Forget about that useless definition.
- From Wiki, Statistics is formally defined as the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.

. . .

- **Statistics** is a subject dealing with data, or **Science of Data**.

::: notes

- So, **Statistics** is a **Science of Data**.
- There might be another science of data. I'm not saying statistics is THE science of data.

- A __*science of data*__ using **statistical thinking, methods and models**.

## Statistics is a Science of Data, so What is Data?

- **Data**: A set of **objects** on which we observe or measure one or more **characteristics**.

- Objects are individuals, observations, subjects or cases in statistical studies.

- A characteristic or attribute is called a **variable** because it *varies* from one to another.


::: notes

- All right. Statistics is a Science of Data, so What is Data?
- Let's define Data.
- A data set is a set of **objects** on which we observe or measure one or more **characteristics**.
- Objects are individuals, observations, subjects or cases in statistical studies.
- A characteristic or attribute is called a **variable** because it *varies* from one to another.

:::

::: tiny
```{r}
#| label: mu_data
roster <- read.csv("./data/marquette_roster_2024_25.csv")
kable(roster, align = "c")
```
:::



::: notes

- For example, the data set right here is a set of Marquette mens basketball players.
- So objects are individuals or players in the data.
- And each player has several characteristics or attributes shown in columns associated with him.
- For example, his #, class, position, height, weight, hometown, and high school.
- These characteristics are called variables because they vary form one to another. Clear?

:::



## Data Matrix

- Each row corresponds to a unique case or observational unit.

- Each column represents a characteristic or variable.

- This structure allows new cases to be added as rows or new variables as new columns.

::: tiny
```{r}
#| ref.label: mu_data

::: notes

- And we usually store a data set in a matrix form that has rows and columns.
- Each row corresponds to a unique case or observational unit, or the object.

## Target Population

- The first step in conducting a study is to *identify questions* to be investigated.

- A clear research question is helpful in identifying 
  + what *cases* should be studied (row)
  + what *variables* are important (column)
  
- Target **Population**: the collection of **all** objects which we are interested in studying from.

::::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

- *What is the average GPA of currently enrolled Marquette students?*

::: small
```{r}
#| out-width: 60%
knitr::include_graphics("./images/02-overview/study.jpeg")
```
:::

::: notes

- Target **Population**: The **complete** collection of data we'd like to make inference about. 
- So the population is a set of **all** objects which we are interested in studying from. 
- Because All Marquette undergrads that are currently enrolled is the **complete** collection of data we'd like to make inference about.
- Each currently enrolled Marquette undergrad is an object.
- Note that students who are not currently enrolled or students that are already graduated are not our interest, and they shouldn't be a part of target population.
- Can anybody tell me what variable associated with Marquette undergrads is our interest?
- So average GPA is the variable or population property we like to make inference about.

- **Sample**: A **subset** of cases selected from a population.

- Compute the average GPA of the sample data

- Hope sample avg GPA $\approx$ population avg GPA. `r emo::ji('please')`


::: notes

- So sampling is our solution to it. 
- A **Sample** is A **subset** of cases selected from a population.
- And the idea is that OK, we are not able to compute the average GPA of a population, but we collect a sample from that population which has way less objects than the population.
- And then we compute the average GPA of the sample data.
- And we hope the sample average GPA can be close to the population average GPA because the population GPA is our main interest, not the sample GPA.
- To have sample average GPA close to population GPA, we want the sample to look like the population so that the sample and the population share similar attribute including GPA.

## How and Why a Representative Sample?

- We always seek to **randomly** select a sample from a population.

- Lots of statistical methods are based on *randomness assumption*.

```{r}
#| ref.label: sample
```


::: notes

- We always seek to **randomly** select a sample from a population because random sampling usually give us a Representative Sample, as long as the sample size, or the number of objects in the sample is not too small.
- So in the example, the proportion of major in our sample should look pretty similar to the proportion of our target population, which is all marquette students.
- If data are not collected in a random framework, these statistical methods – the estimates and errors associated with the estimates – are not reliable.

## Simple Random Sample

- **Random Sample**: Each member of a population is **equally likely** to be selected.

- **Simple Random Sample (SRS)**: Every possible sample of sample size $n$ has the same chance to be chosen.

- **Example**: If sample 100 students from all, say 10,000 Marquette students, I would *randomly* assign each student a number (from 1 to 10,000), then *randomly* select 100 numbers.

## Stratified Random Sample

- **Stratified Sampling**: Subdivide the population into different subgroups (strata) that share the **same** characteristics, then draw a simple random sample from each subgroup.

- **Homogeneous within strata; Non-homogeneous between strata**

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/02-overview/stratified_sampling.png")
```

## Cluster Sampling

- **Cluster Sampling**: Divide the population into clusters, then randomly select some of those clusters, and then choose **all** the members from those selected clusters.

- **Homogeneous between clusters; Non-homogeneous within clusters**

knitr::include_graphics("./images/02-overview/cluster_sampling.png")

::: notes

- clusters look similar each other, but members in a cluster are not very alike. They have different characteristics.
- Homogeneous between clusters because all classes are STEM classes.
- Non-homogeneous within clusters because students in the same class may have different majors or from different colleges

## Categorical vs. Numerical Variables

- A **categorical** variable provides *non-numerical* information which can be placed in **one (and only one)** category from two or more categories.

  + <span style="color:blue">Gender (Male  `r emo::ji('man')`, Female  `r emo::ji('woman')`,  Trans  `r emo::ji('rainbow_flag')`) </span> 
  + <span style="color:blue">Class (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Graduate) </span>
  + <span style="color:blue">Country (USA `r emo::ji('us')`, Canada `r emo::ji('canada')`, UK `r emo::ji('uk')`, Germany `r emo::ji('de')`, Japan `r emo::ji('jp')`, Korea `r emo::ji('kr')`) </span> 


- A **numerical** variable is recorded in a *numerical* value representing counts or measurements.

  + <span style="color:blue"> GPA </span> 
  + <span style="color:blue"> The number of relationships you've had </span>
  + <span style="color:blue"> Height </span> 
  
::: notes


:::



## Numerical Variables can be Discrete or Continuous

- A **discrete** variable takes on values of a **finite** or **countable** number.

- A **continuous** variable takes on values **anywhere** over a particular range *without gaps or jumps*.

  + <span style="color:blue"> GPA is **continuous** because it can be any value between 0 and 4. </span> 
  + <span style="color:blue"> The number of relationships you've had is **discrete** because you can count the number and it is finite.</span>
  + <span style="color:blue"> Height is **continuous** because it can be any number within a range. </span> 

::: notes


:::


## Categorical Variables are Usually Recorded as Numbers

  + <span style="color:blue">Gender (Male = 0, Female = 1, Trans = 2) </span>
  + <span style="color:blue">Class (Freshman = 1, Sophomore = 2, Junior = 3, Senior = 4, Graduate = 5) </span> 
  + <span style="color:blue">Country (USA = 100, Canada = 101, UK = 200, Germany = 201, Japan = 300, Korea = 301) </span> 
  + <span style="color:blue">United Airlines boarding groups</span> 

  + **The numbers represent categories only; differences between them are meaningless.**
    * Canada - USA = 101 - 100 = 1?
    * Graduate - Sophomore = 5 - 2 = 3 = Junior?
  + We need to learn the **level of measurements** to know whether or which arithmetic operations are meaningful.
  

::: notes


:::



## Levels of Measurements: Nominal and Ordinal for Categorical Variables

- **Nominal**: The data can *NOT be ordered* in a meaningful or natural way.
  + <span style="color:blue">Gender (Male = 0, Female = 1, Trans = 2) </span> is **nominal** because Male, Female and Trans cannot be ordered.
  + <span style="color:blue">Country (USA = 100, Canada = 101, UK = 200, Germany = 201, Japan = 300, Korea = 301) </span> is **nominal**.
  
<br> 

- **Ordinal**: The data can be arranged in some meaningful order, but differences between data values can NOT be determined or are meaningless.
  + <span style="color:blue">Class (Freshman = 1, Sophomore = 2, Junior = 3, Senior = 4, Graduate = 5) </span> is **ordinal** because Sophomore is one class higher than Freshman.

::: notes


:::

## Levels of Measurements: Interval and Ratio for Numerical Variables

- **Interval**: The data have meaningful difference between any two values. But the data do NOT have a **natural zero or starting point**. The data can do $\color{red} +$ and $\color{red} -$, but can't reasonably do $\color{red} \times$ and $\color{red} \div$. 
  + <span style="color:blue">Temperature</span> is **interval** because $80^{\circ}$F is 40 degrees higher than $40^{\circ}$F $(80-40=40)$, but $0^{\circ}$ does not mean NO heat and $80^{\circ}$F is NOT twice as hot as $40^{\circ}$F.
  
. . .

- **Ratio**: The data have both meaningful differences and ratios, and there is a natural zero starting point that indicates none of the quantity. The data can do $\color{red} +$, $\color{red} -$,  $\color{red} \times$ and $\color{red} \div$.
  + <span style="color:blue">Distance</span> is **ratio** because $80$ miles is twice as far as $40$ miles $(80/40 = 2)$, and $0$ mile means no distance.

## Converting Numerical to Categorical

- You've already seen an example.
