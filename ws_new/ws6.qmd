(@) For each alternative, say whether it is right-tailed, left-tailed or two sided.
(a) $H_1: \mu \ne 50$
(b) $H_1: \mu > 50$
(c) $H_1: \mu < 50$

```{r}
#| include: false
# (a) two-sided (b) right-tailed (c) left-tailed
```



(@) We are testing $H_0: \mu = 100$. A sample gives $\bar{x} = 106$ with standard error $SE = 2$.
(a) Compute the test statistic $z$.
(b) The rejection rule is $|z| > 2$. Do you reject $H_0$?

```{r}
#| include: false
# (a) z_test = 3 (b) reject H_0
```
