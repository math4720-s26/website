(@) A student says, “My confidence interval for $\mu$ is $\overline{x} \pm 2s$.” What is the main problem with this, conceptually?



```{r}
#| include: false
# The interval must use the standard error, not the sample standard deviation. The interval ignores sample size and will usually be far too wide.
```



(@) A sample mean is $\overline{x} = 50$. The standard error of $\overline{x}$ is $SE = 2$. Give an approximate 95 percent confidence interval for μ. Let's assume the critical value is 2.

```{r}
#| include: false
# (46,54)
```
