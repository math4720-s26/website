(@) **Sampling distribution.** A population has $σ=10$. What sample size $n$ is needed so that the standard deviation of the sample mean is one, $SD(\overline{X}) = 1$?


```{r}
#| include: false
# n = 100
```


(@) **Central limit theorem** True or false, with a short explanation.
(a) If the population is normal, then $\overline{X}$ is normal for any sample size $n$.
(b) If the population is not normal, then the distribution of $\overline{X}$ does not look like normal for any sample size $n$.
(c) If the sample is large, the population becomes normal.

```{r}
#| include: false
# (a) T
# (b) F CLT
# (c) F increasing sample size does not change the population distribution itself.
```
