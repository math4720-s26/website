(@) You have 4 groups and a total sample size 40. Find $df_T$, $df_B$ and $df_W$.

```{r}
#| include: false
# 39, 3, 36.
```



(@) We run one way ANOVA with $p$-value $< \alpha$. What can we conclude, and what can we not conclude?

```{r}
#| include: false
# You can conclude there is strong evidence that at least one population mean differs.
# You cannot conclude which groups differ or how many differ without follow up comparisons (post hoc tests or planned contrasts).
```
