(@) A researcher studies how weekly study hours predict exam score. What is the explanatory variable? What is the response variable?

```{r}
#| include: false
# (a) Explanatory: weekly study hours. (b) Response: exam score.
```



(@) A fitted regression line is $\hat{y} = 50 + 3x$, where $x$ is study hours per week and $y$ is exam score.
(a) Interpret the slope 3 in context.
(b) Interpret the intercept 50 in context.

```{r}
#| include: false
# (a) For each additional 1 hour of study per week, the predicted exam score increases by 3 points, on average.
# (b) When study hours are 0, the predicted exam score is 50 points. It is a model based extrapolation and may or may not be meaningful if 0 hours is outside the data range.
