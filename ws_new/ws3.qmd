(@) **Pick the correct model.** Choose binomial, Poisson, or normal. Give one reason.
(a) Number of heads in 20 coin flips.
(b) Number of typos on a page of a long book.
(c) Heights of adult women.


```{r}
#| include: false
# 11a Binomial. 11b Poisson. 11c Normal.
```

(@) **Normal symmetry facts.** If $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, decide without calculating:
(a) $P(X>\mu)$ is 0.5, less than 0.5, or greater than 0.5?
(b) Which is larger: $P(X>μ+σ)$ or $P(X<μ−σ)$? Why?

```{r}
#| include: false
# 15a 0.5. 15b equal by symmetry.
```
