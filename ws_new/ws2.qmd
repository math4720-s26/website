**Global warming.** A Pew Research poll asked 1,306 Americans "From what you've read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?". The table below shows the distribution of responses by party and ideology, where the
counts have been replaced with relative frequencies.

(a) Are believing that the earth is warming and being a liberal Democrat mutually exclusive?
(b) What is the probability that a randomly chosen respondent believes the earth is warming or is a liberal Democrat?
(c) What is the probability that a randomly chosen respondent believes the earth is warming given that he is a liberal Democrat?

<!-- **Answer:** -->

```{r}
#| include: false
# (a) No, 0.18 of respondents fall into this combination.
# (b) P(earth is warming or liberal Democrat) =
# = P(earth is warming) + P(liberal Democrat) - P(earth is warming and liberal Democrat)
# = 0.60 + 0.20 - 0.18 = 0.62
# (c) P(earth is warming j liberal Democrat) = 0:18
# 0:20 = 0:9
# (d) P(earth is warming j conservative Republican) = 0:11
# 0:33 = 0:33
# (e) No, the two appear to be dependent. The percentages of conservative Republicans and liberal
# Democrats who believe that there is solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has
# been getting warmer over the past few decades are very different.
# (f) P(moderate/liberal Republican j not warming) = 0:06
# 0:34 = 0:18
