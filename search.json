Suppose that 60% of Americans have had chickenpox by the time they reach adulthood.\n\n\nSuppose we take a random sample of 6 American adults. Let \\(X\\) be the number of people out of the 6 who had chickenpox during childhood. If \\(X \\sim binomial(n, \\pi)\\), determine the value of \\(n\\) and \\(\\pi\\).\nWith (a), compute the probability that at least 3 adults have had chickenpox.\nWith (a), what is the value of the mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) of \\(X \\sim binomial(n, \\pi)\\)?\nNow treat \\(X\\) as a normal random variable, i.e., \\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), where \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are the values obtained in (c). Compute the probability that at least 3 adults have had chickenpox.\nSuppose now we take a random sample of 60 American adults. Using \\(binomial(n, \\pi)\\) and \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) with new parameter values \\(n\\), \\(\\mu\\), and \\(\\sigma^2\\) to compute the probability that at least 30 adults have had chickenpox.\nCompare binomial and normal probabilities when sample size are 6 and 60. In which case, binomial and normal probabilities are closer?\n(MSSC) Is there any issue when we use a normal distribution to approximate a binomial distribution? Use continuity correction on (e). Do you get a better approximation result?\n\n\n\nAs part of a study to determine factors that may explain differences in animal species relative to their size, the following body masses (in grams) of 50 different bird species were reported in the paper ``Temperature and the Northern Distributions of Wintering Birds,’’ by Richard Repasky (1991). The data are provided in exam1data.csv. First download and upload the data to your RStudio. Then import the data using the following command like\n\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"./exam1data.csv\")\n\nwhere \"./exam1data.csv\" is the file path and ./ means your current working directory.\n\nMake a histogram of bodymass.\nConstruct a boxplot with label X-axis or Y-axis (depending on whether the plot is horizontal or vertical) as Body Mass (in grams) with a title Boxplot of Body Mass (g). Are there any outliers in the data set? If yes, identify them.\nFind 30-th, 60-th and 90-th percentiles (or 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 quantiles) as wells as the sample mean and median. Based on (a), (b), and (c), comment the skewness of the data, and which should be a better measure of center.\n\nMany statistical methods assume data are normally distributed, and the Quantile-Quantile plot or QQ plot helps us check the normality assumption. If the data are approximately normally distributed, the points on the QQ plot will lie close to a straight line.\n\nRemove the outliers you identified in (b) and construct a QQ-plot for the data by using the functions qqnorm() and qqline(). Does the distribution without outliers look like normal? Please comment.\nTransform the data with outliers removed by taking the natural log with base \\(e = 2.71828...\\). Construct a QQ-plot for the transformed data and comment on its normality.\n\n\n\n\nAI Usage Declaration. Using GenAI is permitted for this course. If you choose to use GenAI to assist with your exam, you must include a brief statement documenting your use. Please provide the following information:\n\n\nWhy/How I Used AI Why do you need to use GenAI? Which tool did you use? Describe your prompts or questions. What and how did you ask the AI to help you?\nGenerated Output Include a screenshot or excerpt (copy and paste) of the AI’s response.\nHow I Used the Output Did you revise it? Did you use it directly, or compare it with your answers? What decisions did you make based on the output?"

Conclusion\nWrite a clear summary of your findings in ordinary language.\n\n\nData set\nThe data set can be downloaded here. This data set contains three numerical variables measured for a group of individuals. Each variable is described below.\n\nVariable sleep\n\nDescription: Average number of hours of sleep per night during a typical week\nUnit: Hours\nTypical Range: About 5.0 to 8.5 hours\n\n\n\nVariable caffeine\n\nDescription: Average daily caffeine intake from all sources including coffee, tea, soda, or energy drinks\nUnit: Milligrams of caffeine per day\nTypical Range: About 65 to 290 milligrams\n\n\n\nVariable stress\n\nDescription: Perceived stress score based on a short survey. Higher values indicate greater stress.\nScale Range: 0 to 40\nTypical Range in this sample: About 11 to 33\n\nStress is a common concern among adults and college students. Many people believe that lifestyle choices such as sleep and caffeine consumption can influence how stressed a person feels. Sleep is often thought to reduce stress because it allows the body and mind to recover. Caffeine is often used to stay alert, but higher caffeine intake may increase feelings of tension or restlessness.\nResearchers are interested in understanding how these everyday behaviors relate to stress levels. In real health studies, researchers often collect data on sleep habits, caffeine consumption, and stress scores to explore these relationships. Multiple linear regression provides a useful way to examine how two different predictors together relate to a single outcome.\nThis simulated data set reflects these ideas. It includes information on sleep hours, caffeine intake, and perceived stress scores for a group of individuals. The goal is to model stress as a function of sleep and caffeine and to understand how the two predictors together help explain variation in stress levels.\nYou can use the following questions in the Introduction section as motivation for your analysis:\n\nHow is sleep related to stress when we account for differences in caffeine intake?\nHow is caffeine intake related to stress when we account for differences in sleep?\nDo sleep and caffeine together help explain variation in perceived stress scores?\nWhich of the two predictors appears to have a stronger association with stress in this sample?\n\nThese questions help motivate why multiple linear regression is appropriate for this data set.",

We can subset a list by name or by indexing.\nSuppose we want the first element of the list, we can get it by its name using x_lst$idx.\nWe can also obtain it by using indexing like x_lst[[1]] because we want the first element.\nNotice that the way we subset a list returns an integer vector, the real first element of the list, not a list.\nLet’s see another case on the right.\nWe can also subset by name using single pair of brackets, and put the name inside the brackets.\nOr we can subset by indexing, again using single pair of brackets.\nAnd you see what happened? The way we subset a list here returns a sub-list, not the element itself.\nSo please be careful when subsetting a list.\nIf you want a vector, use these ways. If you want to keep it as a list, use these ways."

Multiple files or a file that is not in pdf format is not accepted.\nIn your homework, please number questions in order.\n\n\nQuestions started with (MSSC) are required for MSSC 5720 students, and optional for MATH 4720 students.\n\nHomework Questions\n\n\nData Type. Identify each of the following as numerical or categorical data.\n\nThe names of the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture aspirin tablets\nThe colors of pills\nThe weights of aspirin tablets\n\n\n\n\n  # (a) Categorical\n  # (b) Categorical\n  # (c) Numerical\n\n\n\n\nLevel of Measurements. Identify the level of measurement used in each of the following.\n\nThe weights of people in a sample of Marquette engineering students.\nA physician’s descriptions of “abstains from alcohol, light drinker, moderate drinker, heavy drinker.”\nTree classifications of “oak, maple, elm.”\nBob measures time in days, with 0 corresponding to his birth date. The day before his birth is -1, the day after his birth is +1, and so on. Bib has converted the dates of major historical events to his numbering system. What is the level of measurement of these numbers?\n\n\n\n\n  # (a) Ratio\n  # (b) Ordinal\n  # (c) Nominal\n  # (d) Interval\n\n\n\n\nDiscrete vs Continuous. Determine whether the data are discrete or continuous.\n\nThe length of stay (in days) for each baby in a sample of babies born in Wisconsin.\nSeveral subjects are randomly selected and their heights are recorded.\nFrom a data set, we see that a female had an arm circumference of 32.49 cm.\nA sample of married couples is randomly selected and the number of children in each family is recorded.\n\n\n\n\n  # (a) Discrete\n  # (b) Continuous\n  # (c) Continuous\n  # (d) Discrete\n\n\n\n\nSampling Method. Identify which of these types of sampling is used: random, stratified, or cluster.\n\nDr. Yu surveys his statistics class by identifying groups of males and females, then randomly selecting 5 students from each of those two groups.\nDr. Yu conducts a survey by randomly selecting 3 different classes at Marquette and surveying all of the students as they left those classes.\n532 subjects were randomly assigned to (1) regular exercise or (2) no exercise groups to study the effectiveness of exercise in lowering blood pressure.\n\n\n\n\n  # (a) Stratified\n  # (b) Cluster\n  # (c) Random\n\n\n\n\nStudy Type. Determine whether the study is an experiment or an observational study, then identify a major problem with this study.\n\nIn a survey conducted by USA Today, 1072 Internet users chose to respond to the question:“How often do you seek medical information online?” 38% of the respondents said “frequently.”\nThe Physicians’ Health Study involved 22,071 male physicians. Based on random selections, 11,037 of them were treated with aspirin and other other 11,034 were given placebos. The study was stopped early because it became clear that aspirin reduced the risk of myocardial infarctions by a substantial amount.\n\n\n\n\n  # (a) Observational: self-reported voluntary sample may not be representative and may be biased. The question is posted in E-newsletter, so the sample is biased from the begining.\n  # (b) Experiment: Male physicians only. Better to include male and female who are not physicians.\n\n\n\n\n(MSSC) UK baby names. The visualization below shows the number of baby girls born in the United Kingdom (comprised of England & Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland) who were given the name “Fiona” over the years.\n\nList the variables you believe were necessary to create this visualization.\nIndicate whether each variable is numerical or categorical.

You want to construct a data frame that describes the main characteristics of eight planets in our solar system. You feel confident enough to create the necessary vectors: name, type, diameter, rotation and rings that have already been coded up as above. The first element in each of these vectors correspond to the first observation.\n\nUse the function data.frame() to construct a data frame. Pass the vectors name, type, diameter, rotation and rings as arguments to data.frame(), in this order. Call the resulting data frame planets_df.\nUse str() to investigate the structure of the new planets_df variable. Which are categorical (qualitative) variables and which are numerical (quantitative) variables? For those that are categorical, are they nominal or ordinal? For those numerical variables, are they interval or ratio level? discrete or continuous?\nFrom planets_df, select the diameter of Mercury: this is the value at the first row and the third column. Simply print out the result.\nFrom planets_df, select all data on Mars (the fourth row). Simply print out the result.\nSelect and print out the first 5 values in the diameter column of planets_df.\nUse $ to select the rings variable from planets_df.\nUse (f) to select all columns for planets that have rings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Description and Graphics. We use the data set mtcars to do data summary and graphics. Type ?mtcars for the description of the data set.\n\nUse the function pie() to create a pie chart for the number of cylinders (cyl). Show the plot. What the number of cylinders has the most frequencies in the data?\nUse the function barplot() to create a bar chart for the number of gears (gear). Show the plot. What the number of gears has the most frequencies in the data?\nUse the function hist() to generate a histogram of the gross horsepower (hp). Show the plot. Is it right or left-skewed?\nUse the function boxplot() to generate a boxplot of car weight (wt). Show the plot. Are there any outliers?\nUse the function plot() to create a scatter plot of displacement (disp) vs. miles per gallon (mpg). Show the plot. As the displacement increases, the miles per gallon tends to increase or decrease?\nCompute the mean, median and standard deviation of the miles per gallon (mpg).      \n\n\n\n\nTo save your figures, in RStudio you go to tab Plots &gt; Export &gt; Save as Image &gt; choose Image format (PNG is good), choose where the image is saved (Directory), type the File name, decide Width and Height &gt; Click Save. To download an image file to your local computer, select the file, go to More &gt; Export &gt; Download. You could take screenshots of plots or code to show your work too.\n\n\n\n(MSSC) R List Data Structure. A list in R allows you to gather a variety of objects under one name (that is, the name of the list) in an ordered way. These objects can be matrices, vectors, data frames, even other lists. Alos, it is not required that these objects are related to each other in any way.\n\nUse command list() to create a list named employee of three elements, name, salary, and union with value \"Joe\", 55000 and TRUE respectively. Print employee.\nConstruct a list, named my_list that contains 3 list components: days_vec, planets_df, and employee. Print the structure of my_list.\n\nWhat is the difference between my_list[[1]] and my_list[1]? What is the data type they return?\nObtain the salary in employee from my_list using $.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Usage Declaration. Using GenAI is permitted for this course.

The process is designed such that the amount of juice in the containers has a normal distribution with a mean of 64.3 ounces and a standard deviation of .15 ounces. The process is monitored by randomly selecting 24 containers every hour and measuring the actual amount of juice in the containers. An increase in the standard deviation beyond .15 ounces with the mean remaining at 64.3 ounces will result in a production run with too many underfilled and overfilled containers. The following data are the actual amounts of juice in a random sample of 24 containers.\n\nIf the amount of juice in the containers has a normal distribution with a mean of 64.3 ounces and a standard deviation of .15 ounces, what proportion of containers filled on the production line will be underfilled (contain less than 64 ounces)?\nConstruct a 95% confidence interval on the process standard deviation.\nDo the test on the claim that the process standard deviation is greater than .15 ounces. Use \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\).\nWhat is the p-value of your test in (c)? (We can use pchisq())\nIf you do (b) and (c) correctly, you should find that (b) and (c) lead to a different conclusion about the claim that \\(\\sigma &gt; 0.15\\).

Multiple files or a file that is not in pdf format is not allowed.\n\n\nHandwritten tables and figures receive no credits.\nYou do not need to attach your code of any language you use in the homework. However, if you fail to complete your calculations or produce your table or figure, you receive partial credits if your code is attached.\nQuestions started with (MSSC) are required for MSSC 5720 students, and optional for MATH 4720 students.\n\nHomework Questions\n\nWhat percent of a standard normal distribution \\(N(\\mu=0, \\sigma=1)\\) is found in each region? Draw a normal graph may help.\n\n\\(-0.4 &lt; Z &lt; 1.5\\)\n\\(|Z| &gt; 2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average daily high temperature in June in Milwaukee is 77\\(^{\\circ}\\) F with a standard deviation of 5\\(^{\\circ}\\) F. Suppose that the temperatures in June closely follow a normal distribution.\n\nWhat is the probability of observing an 83\\(^{\\circ}\\) F temperature or higher in Milwaukee during a randomly chosen day in June?\nHow cool are the coldest 10% of the days (days with lowest average high temperature) during June in Milwaukee?\n\n\n\n\n\nData collected by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) suggests that 70% of 18-20 year olds consumed alcoholic beverages in any given year.\n\nSuppose a random sample of ten 18-20 year olds is taken. When does it make sense to use binomial distribution for calculating the probability that exactly six consumed alcoholic beverages? \n\nWhat is the probability that exactly four out of ten 18-20 year olds have consumed an alcoholic beverage?\nWhat is the probability that at most 2 out of 5 randomly sampled 18-20 year olds have consumed alcoholic beverages?\n\n\n\n\n\nA Starbucks in Chicago serves an average of 75 customers per hour during the morning rush.\n\nWhich distribution have we studied that is most appropriate for calculating the probability of a given number of customers arriving within one hour during this time of day?\nCalculate the probability that this Starbucks serves 70 customers in one hour during this time of day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(MSSC) In observing patients administered a new drug product in a properly conducted clinical trial, the number of persons experiencing a particular side effect might be quite small. Suppose \\(\\pi\\) (the probability a person experiences a side effect to the drug) is \\(.001\\) and \\(1,000\\) patients in the clinical trial received the drug.\n\nUse binomial distribution to Compute the probability that none of a random sample of \\(n = 1,000\\) patients administered the drug experiences a particular side effect.\nUse Poisson distribution to Compute the probability that none of a random sample of \\(n = 1,000\\) patients administered the drug experiences a particular side effect. [Hint:] The parameter \\(\\lambda = n\\pi\\).\nWhen \\(n\\) is large and \\(\\pi\\) is small, Poisson\\((\\lambda)\\) looks pretty similar to binomial\\((n, \\pi)\\). Plot the two distributions for \\(x = 0, 1, \\dots, 8\\). Are they similar?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Usage Declaration. Using GenAI is permitted for this course.

Find the degrees of freedom and the critical \\(t\\)-value for the given sample size and confidence level.\n\n\n\\(n = 6\\), confidence level 90%\n\n\\(n = 21\\), confidence level 98%\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are summary statistics for randomly selected weights of newborn girls: \\(n =205\\), \\(\\bar{x} = 30.4\\)hg (1hg = 100 grams), \\(s = 7.1\\)hg.\n\nCompute a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\), the mean weight of newborn girls.\nAre the result in (a) very different from the 95% confidence interval if \\(\\sigma = 7.1\\)? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\nA 95% confidence interval for a population mean \\(\\mu\\) is given as \\((18.98, 21.02)\\). This confidence interval is based on a simple random sample of 36 observations. Calculate the sample mean and standard deviation. Assume that all conditions necessary for inference are satisfied. Use the \\(t\\)-distribution in any calculations.\n\n\n\nA market researcher wants to evaluate car insurance savings at a competing company. Based on past studies he is assuming that the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) of savings is $100. He wants to collect data such that he can get a margin of error of no more than $10 at a 95% confidence level. How large of a sample should he collect?\n\n\n\n\n(MSSC) Nonparametric methods for estimating a population mean do not assume any specific distributional form (like normality) for the population. Instead, they rely on the data’s rank or resampling properties. Describe the idea of boostrapping, and how we can use boostrapping to construct a confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\).\n\n\n\n\nAI Usage Declaration. Using GenAI is permitted for this course.

A Pew Research survey asked 2,373 randomly sampled registered voters their political affiliation (Republican, Democrat, or Independent) and whether or not they identify as swing voters. 35% of respondents identified as Independent, 23% identified as swing voters, and 11% identified as both.\n\n\nWhat percent of voters are Independent but not swing voters?\nWhat percent of voters are Independent or swing voters?\nWhat percent of voters are neither Independent nor swing voters?\nIs the event that someone is a swing voter independent of the event that someone is a political Independent?\n\n\n\n\nConditional Probability and Independence. A Pew Research poll asked 1,306 Americans ``From what you’ve read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?“. The table below shows the distribution of responses by party and ideology, where the counts have been replaced with relative frequencies.\n\n\nTable 1.

Explain your reasoning. \n\n\n\n\n\nBayes Formula. After an MATH 4720/MSSC 5720 course, 80% of students can successfully construct box plots using R. Of those who can construct box plots, 86% passed, while only 65% of those students who could not construct box plots passed. Calculate the probability that a student is able to construct a box plot if it is known that she passed.\n\n\n\n\n(MSSC) Lupus is a medical phenomenon where antibodies that are supposed to attack foreign cells to prevent infections instead see plasma proteins as foreign bodies, leading to a high risk of blood clotting. It is believed that 2% of the population suffer from this disease. The test is 98% accurate if a person actually has the disease. The test is 74% accurate if a person does not have the disease. There is a line from the Fox television show House that is often used after a patient tests positive for lupus: “It’s never lupus.” Do you think there is truth to this statement? Use appropriate probabilities to support your answer.\n\n\n\n\nAI Usage Declaration. Using GenAI is permitted for this course.

Maru records rainfall in inches and Lulu in centimeters. How will their correlation coefficients compare?\n\n\n\nSuppose we fit a regression line to predict the shelf life of an apple based on its weight.

Does the scatterplot suggest a linear relationship between the two variables? Are they positively or negatively related?\nLet \\(y\\) be the amount of nicotine and let \\(x\\) be the amount of tar. Fit a simple linear regression to the data and identify the sample regression equation.\nWhat percentage of the variation in nicotine can be explained by the linear correlation between nicotine and tar?\nThe Raleigh brand king size cigarette is not included in the table, and it has 23 mg of tar. What is the best predicted amount of nicotine? How does the predicted amount compare to the actual amount of 1.3 mg of nicotine?

However, the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) paradigm and the p-value usage have been much criticized and shown to be problematic and often misused in data analysis. In fact, in his research, Dr. Yu never does NHST or uses p-value taught in MATH 4720. Please read the articles\n\nRonald L. Wasserstein and Nicole A.

They are two different things.\nWith packages, we can do lots of things without writing our own code, and we can just use the functions provided in packages to do our job. It saves us lots of time.\nA language with many great add-on packages can become a very useful language.\npackages: which is a collection of functions and data for people to use.\nUnlike other languages, R was created by statisticians, for statisticians to use.\nSo R is not a general-purpose programming language like python or java, but it is specifically for data science. And that’s probably why you don’t learn R in an intro programming course.\nSo you can view Python as a smart phone. It can do many different things, phone, camera, email, social media. But R is like a high quality camera. It can’t receive emails, but it produces high quality photos.\nRStudio is not a programming language, but a software application.\nCode itself is just a text file. You can use any text editor or software to write your code.\n\nRStudio is a product of Posit data science company."

To see if this number had changed, researchers conducted a new survey in 2008 before industry numbers were reported. The survey included 1,500 households and found that average Halloween spending was $58 per household.\nThe average GPA of students in 2001 at a private university was 3.37.

Samples of weights of adult human brains, each of size \\(n=15\\), are randomly collected and the sample means are found. Is it correct to conclude that the sample means cannot be treated as being from a normal distribution because the sample size is too small?\n\n\n# No. because the original population is normally distributed, the sample means\n# will be normally distributed for any sample size, not just for n &gt; 30.\n\n\n\nAnnual incomes of physicians are known to have a distribution that is skewed to the right instead of being normally distributed. Assume that we collect a large (\\(n &gt; 30\\)) random sample of annual income of physicians. Can the distribution of those incomes in that sample be approximated by a normal distribution because the sample is large?\n\n\n# No. The sample of annual incomes will tend to have a distribution that is\n# skewed to the right, no matter how large the sample is. If we compute the\n# sample mean, we can consider that value to be one value in a normally\n# distributed population."

Marquette data center director said that the population of ACT score of engineering majors follows a normal distribution with the population variance of value 9.\n\nIs the claim a \\(H_0\\) or \\(H_1\\) claim? Write down \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) based on her claim. Is this a left-tailed, right-tailed, or two-tailed test? Please explain.\nDue to COVID-19, Marquette’s research budget is cut. The professor’s assistant can only collect a small random sample of size 16. Are one-sample \\(z\\)-test and/or \\(t\\)-test procedures appropriate with such a small size? If yes, why? If not, add conditions to make the procedures appropriate.\nThe assistant never takes MATH 4720 and she only remembers that the professor said 31.7 is the threshold value to be compared with the observed sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\).

A quality control engineer randomly selects shields produced by each of the machines and records the inside diameter of each shield (in millimeters), as shown in Table 1. The data can be downloaded at shield_machine.csv. She wants to determine whether the mean diameter produced by the three machines differ.\n\nCheck normality and homogeneity of variance using QQ-plot and boxplot. Comment on your plots.\nBased on your findings in (a), would it be appropriate to proceed with an analysis of variance (ANOVA)? Please explain.\nIf your answer is YES in (b), conduct ANOVA on the original data. If NOT, do the natural log (log with base \\(e = 2.71828...\\)) transformation on the data and show the transformed data satisfy ANOVA assumptions. Then conduct ANOVA on the transformed data.
