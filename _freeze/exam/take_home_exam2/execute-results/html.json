She would like to collect evidence of her claim and do a hypothesis testing. Marquette data center director said that the population of ACT score of engineering majors follows a normal distribution with the population variance of value 9.\n    (a) Is the claim a $H_0$ or $H_1$ claim? Write down $H_0$ and $H_1$ based on her claim. Is this a left-tailed, right-tailed, or two-tailed test? Please explain.\n    (b) Due to COVID-19, Marquette's research budget is cut. The professor's assistant can only collect a small random sample of size 16. Are one-sample $z$-test and/or $t$-test procedures appropriate with such a small size? If yes, why? If not, add conditions to make the procedures appropriate.\n    (c) The assistant never takes MATH 4720 and she only remembers that the professor said 31.7 is the threshold value to be compared with the observed sample mean $\\overline{x}$. Should she reject $H_0$ when $\\bar{x} > 31.7$ or when $\\bar{x} < 31.7$? Please explain.\n    (d) Given the rejection region in (c), write down the definition of the Type I error rate in the problem and determine its value.\n    (e) If the $p$-value is 0.1, what is the value of observed sample mean $\\overline{x}$?\n    (f) Based on (c), (d), (e), Is $H_0$ rejected?\n    <!-- (g) **(MSSC)** Write down the definition of the Type II error rate in the problem and determine its value if the true mean ACT score is 31 (the value of $\\mu$ when $H_0$ is false) and the rejection region is $\\{(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{16}): \\overline{x} \\ge 31. 5\\}$. -->\n    <!-- (h) **(MSSC)** The [**statistical power**](https://chenghanyu-introstatsbook.netlify.app/infer-ht#statistical-power-and-choosing-sample-size), which is defined as 1 - type II error rate, or $1-\\beta$, is a way to quantify the quality of a test. The power is the probability that the test correctly reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false. With the rejection region in (g), plot the power curve (power value vs. value of $\\mu$) with mean values 30, 31, 32, 33, 34.

The company wants to evaluate the variation in the inside diameter dimensions of the shields produced by the machine A, B and C. A quality control engineer randomly selects shields produced by each of the machines and records the inside diameter of each shield (in millimeters), as shown in @tbl-anova. The data can be downloaded at [shield_machine.csv](./shield_machine.csv). She wants to determine whether the mean diameter produced by the three machines differ.\n    (a) Check normality and homogeneity of variance using QQ-plot and boxplot. Comment on your plots.\n    (b) Based on your findings in (a), would it be appropriate to proceed with an analysis of variance (ANOVA)? Please explain.\n    (c) If your answer is YES in (b), conduct ANOVA on the original data. If NOT, do the natural log (log with base $e = 2.71828...$) transformation on the data and show the transformed data satisfy ANOVA assumptions. Then conduct ANOVA on the transformed data. Show the ANOVA table and determine whether the mean diameters differ.\n\n::: {#tbl-anova .cell tbl-cap='Sampled data of the inside diameter of shields produced by machine A, B and C.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| Shield| Machine A| Machine B| Machine C|\n|------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|\n|      1|      31.0|      34.2|      39.3|\n|      2|       7.0|      39.8|      36.2|\n|      3|       8.2|      15.8|      47.8|\n|      4|       9.1|      29.8|      58.7|\n|      5|      14.4|      61.1|      82.3|\n|      6|      10.5|      31.1|      30.8|\n|      7|      10.5|      18.3|      11.0|\n|      8|       5.1|      10.6|      15.0|\n|      9|      18.2|      11.2|      46.3|\n|     10|      25.2|      20.0|      36.4|\n|     11|       6.5|      26.9|      54.5|\n|     12|      13.4|      52.6|      25.3|\n|     13|      23.7|      65.2|      24.6|\n|     14|      17.0|      37.3|      90.5|\n|     15|       8.6|      19.0|      64.0|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# ------------\n## (a)\n# ------------\nshield_machine <- read.csv(\"shield_machine.csv\")\nshield_machine_new <- matrix(shield_machine[, 1], 15, 3)\n\ncar::qqPlot(shield_machine_new[, 1])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](take_home_exam2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  1 10\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncar::qqPlot(shield_machine_new[, 2])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](take_home_exam2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 13  5\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncar::qqPlot(shield_machine_new[, 3])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](take_home_exam2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 14  5\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# not very normal but OK\n\nboxplot(shield_machine_new)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](take_home_exam2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-4.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## variances are not homogeneous\n\n# ------------\n## (b)\n# ------------\n## Not appropriate because ANONA requires normality of data and homogeneous variances.\n\n# ------------\n## (d)\n# ------------\napply(shield_machine_new, 2, var)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  59.37781 296.37210 524.69314\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\napply(shield_machine_new, 2, mean)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 13.89333 31.52667 44.18000\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\napply(shield_machine_new, 2, var)/ (apply(shield_machine_new, 2, mean)^2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.3076177 0.2981818 0.2688153\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## log-transformation\nshield_machine_log <- shield_machine\nshield_machine_log[, 1] <- log(shield_machine_log[, 1])\nlm_res_log <- lm(diameter ~ machine, data = shield_machine_log)\nanova(lm_res_log)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: diameter\n          Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(>F)    \nmachine    2 10.456  5.2278  16.404 5.435e-06 ***\nResiduals 42 13.385  0.3187                      \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshield_machine_log_new <- apply(shield_machine_new, 2, log)\napply(shield_machine_log_new, 2, var)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.2871122 0.3234484 0.3454946\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nboxplot(shield_machine_log_new)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](take_home_exam2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-5.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# fitted_val_log <- matrix(lm_res_log$fitted.values, 15, 3)\n# colnames(fitted_val_log) <- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\")\n# qqPlot(lm_res_log$residuals, pch = 19, id = FALSE, ylab = \"residuals\", \n#        main = \"Normal Probability Plot for Residuals\")\n# plot(lm_res_log$fitted.values, lm_res_log$residuals, xlab = \"Fitted Value\",\n#      ylab = \"Residual\", main = \"Versus Fits\", pch = 19, col = \"red\")\n# abline(h = 0)\n\n## another way\n# aov_res <- aov(diameter ~ machine, data = data_sim_log)\n# summary(aov_res)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n(@) **AI Usage Declaration.** Using GenAI is permitted for this course.
