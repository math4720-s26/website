What is the level of measurement of these numbers?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n(@) **Discrete vs Continuous.** Determine whether the data are discrete or continuous.\n    (a) The length of stay (in days) for each baby in a sample of babies born in Wisconsin.\n    (b) Several subjects are randomly selected and their heights are recorded.\n    (c) From a data set, we see that a female had an arm circumference of 32.49 cm.\n    (d) A sample of married couples is randomly selected and the number of children in each family is recorded.\n \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<br>   \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n(@) **Sampling Method.** Identify which of these types of sampling is used: random, stratified, or cluster.\n    (a) Dr. Yu surveys his statistics class by identifying groups of males and females, then randomly selecting 5 students from each of those two groups.\n    (b) Dr. Yu conducts a survey by randomly selecting 3 different classes at Marquette and surveying all of the students as they left those classes.\n    (c) 532 subjects were randomly assigned to (1) regular exercise or (2) no exercise groups to study the effectiveness of exercise in lowering blood pressure.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n(@) **Study Type.** Determine whether the study is an experiment or an observational study, then identify a major problem with this study.\n    (a) In a survey conducted by *USA Today*, 1072 Internet users chose to respond to the question:\"How often do you seek medical information online?\" 38% of the respondents said \"frequently.\"\n    (b) The Physicians' Health Study involved 22,071 male physicians. Based on random selections, 11,037 of them were treated with aspirin and other other 11,034 were given placebos. The study was stopped early because it became clear that aspirin reduced the risk of myocardial infarctions by a substantial amount.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n(@) **(MSSC) UK baby names.** The visualization below shows the number of baby girls born in the United Kingdom (comprised of England & Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland) who were given the name \"Fiona\" over the years.\n    (a) List the variables you believe were necessary to create this visualization.\n    (b) Indicate whether each variable is numerical or categorical.

If categorical, indicate if the variable is ordinal.\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./hw01-fiona.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n(@) **AI Usage Declaration.** Using GenAI is permitted for this course.
