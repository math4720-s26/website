What sample size $n$ is needed so that the standard deviation of the sample mean is one, $SD(\\overline{X}) = 1$?\n\n\n\n\n\n(@) **Central limit theorem** True or false, with a short explanation.\n(a) If the population is normal, then $\\overline{X}$ is normal for any sample size $n$.\n(b) If the population is not normal, then the distribution of $\\overline{X}$ does not look like normal for any sample size $n$.\n(c) If the sample is large, the population becomes normal.\n\n\n",
