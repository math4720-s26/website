Identical twins are necessarily the same sex: half are males and the other half are females. One-quarter of fraternal twins are both male, one-quarter both female, and one-half are mixes: one male, one female. You have just become a parent of twins and are told they are both girls. Given this information, what is the probability that they are identical?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## [(0.5)(0.3)]/[(0.5)(0.3)+(1/4)(0.7)]\n```\n:::\n\n\n<br>  \n\n\n\n(@) A patient named Diana was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, a long-term\nsyndrome of body pain, and was prescribed anti-depressants. Being the skeptic that she is, Diana didn't initially believe that anti-depressants would help her symptoms. However after a couple months of being on the medication she decides that the anti-depressants are working, because she feels like her symptoms are in fact getting better.\n    (a) Write the hypotheses in words for Diana's skeptical position when she started taking the anti-depressants.\n    (b) What is a Type 1 Error in this context?\n    (c) What is a Type 2 Error in this context?\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## (a)\n## H0: Anti-depressants do not affect the symptoms of Fibromyalgia. \n## HA: Anti-depressants do affect the symptoms of Fibromyalgia (either helping or harming).\n## (b)\n## Concluding that anti-depressants either help or worsen Fibromyalgia symptoms \n## when they actually do neither.\n## (c)\n## Concluding that anti-depressants do not affect Fibromyalgia symptoms when they actually do.\n```\n:::\n\n\n<br>  \n\n\n\n(@) A Rasmussen Reports survey of 1,000 US adults found that 42% believe raising the minimum wage will help the economy.

Twenty-five low birth-weight babies were studied at a Harvard teaching hospital; the investigators calculated the regression of head circumference (measured in centimeters) against gestational age (measured in weeks). The estimated regression line is $$\\widehat{\\text{head circumference}} = 3.91 + 0.78 \\times \\text{gestational age}$$\n    (a) What is the predicted head circumference for a baby whose gestational age is 28 weeks?\n    (b) The standard error for the coefficient of gestational age is 0. 35, which is associated with $df = 23$.
