Better: Multinomial or ordinal logistic.   -->\n<!-- 4. **Daily stock price changes** – Heavy tails with extreme values. Better: Student’s t or heavy-tailed distributions.   -->\n<!-- 5. **Number of cars a family owns** – Not fixed trials, not symmetric continuous. Better: Geometric or negative binomial.   -->\n<!-- 6. **Survival time of patients after surgery** – Skewed times to event, cannot be negative. Better: Exponential, Weibull, or survival analysis methods. -->\n",
