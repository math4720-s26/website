Does it look like a normal distribution?\n\n(4) Change 5 to **30** in **Select number of rolls:**\n\n(5) Roll your die **30** times, records your outcomes in **Enter your die rolls separated by commas or spaces:**, then hit **Submit Rolls**.\n\n(6) How does the histogram look compared to the 5-roll sample means?\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n- What happened to the variability of the sample means as sample size increased?\n\n- How did the shape of the distribution change?\n\n- How does this illustrate the Central Limit Theorem?\n\n\n<!-- Key Takeaways -->\n\n<!-- Sample means vary from sample to sample. -->\n\n<!-- As sample size increases, the distribution of sample means: -->\n\n<!-- Becomes approximately normal, regardless of the population distribution (here, uniform die rolls). -->\n\n<!-- Has smaller spread (standard error decreases). -->\n\n<!-- This is the essence of the Central Limit Theorem. -->\n",
