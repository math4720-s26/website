title: "Activity: Sampling Distribution and Central Limit Theorem"
---


## **Objective**

You will experience 

 - how sample means vary, 
 - how a sampling distribution of sample mean is created
 - how they approximate a normal distribution as sample size increases.


## Instructions

(1) Go to Dr. Yu's app <https://cheyu.shinyapps.io/rolling-die/>

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-link: https://cheyu.shinyapps.io/rolling-die/
knitr::include_graphics("../images/rolling-die.png")
```

(2) Roll your die **5** times, records your outcomes in **Enter your die rolls separated by commas or spaces:**, then hit **Submit Rolls**.

(3) Check the histogram of sample means. Does it look like a normal distribution?

(4) Change 5 to **30** in **Select number of rolls:**

(5) Roll your die **30** times, records your outcomes in **Enter your die rolls separated by commas or spaces:**, then hit **Submit Rolls**.

(6) How does the histogram look compared to the 5-roll sample means?



## Discussion

- What happened to the variability of the sample means as sample size increased?

- How did the shape of the distribution change?

- How does this illustrate the Central Limit Theorem?


<!-- Key Takeaways -->

<!-- Sample means vary from sample to sample. -->

<!-- As sample size increases, the distribution of sample means: -->

<!-- Becomes approximately normal, regardless of the population distribution (here, uniform die rolls). -->

<!-- Has smaller spread (standard error decreases). -->

<!-- This is the essence of the Central Limit Theorem. -->
